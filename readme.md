## 📚 What You'll Learn

I’ve covered all the **important TypeScript concepts** with examples and easy explanations:

### 🟢 Core Concepts
- ✅ **Type Inference** – Let TypeScript guess the type for you
- ✅ **Union & Intersection Types** – Combine and merge types
- ✅ **Type Aliases** – Create custom type names
- ✅ **Interfaces** – Define object structures
- ✅ **Enums** – Represent a set of named constants

### 🟣 Advanced Topics
- ✅ **Generics** – Build reusable and flexible types
- ✅ **Type Assertion** – Tell TypeScript what type you expect
- ✅ **Utility Types** – Built-in helpers for productivity:
  - `Partial<T>` – Make all properties optional  
  - `Pick<T, K>` – Select specific properties  
  - `Readonly<T>` – Make properties immutable  
  - `Required<T>` – Make all properties required  
  - Optional & Nullable Types  
  - Function Types  
- ✅ **Type Guards & Narrowing** – Safe runtime type checks
- ✅ **Discriminated Unions** – Handle multiple object types cleanly
