## 📚 Topics Covered  

Here’s what you’ll learn in this series – explained with **clear examples** & **real-world use cases**:  

✨ **Core Concepts**  
- 🔹 **Type Inference** – Let TS guess types for you  
- 🔹 **Union & Intersection Types** – Combine and merge types  
- 🔹 **Type Aliases** – Give names to complex types  
- 🔹 **Interfaces** – Define object structure & contracts  
- 🔹 **Enums** – Work with named constants  

🚀 **Advanced Concepts**  
- 🔹 **Generics** – Reusable & scalable types  
- 🔹 **Type Assertion** – Tell TS what you already know  
- 🔹 **Utility Types** – Built-in helpers:  
  `Partial<T>` | `Pick<T, K>` | `Readonly<T>` | `Required<T>`  
  + Optional & Nullable Types + Function Types  
- 🔹 **Type Guards & Narrowing** – Safe type checking  
- 🔹 **Discriminated Unions** – Handle multiple object types cleanly
